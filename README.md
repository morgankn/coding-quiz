## Description

This project is a javascript quiz, I built it to learn more javascript and how it works with CSS and HTML. I was motivated by using APIs for the first time. I built this application to show the ways that these three programs work together and how dynamic javascript can be. I learned a lot about trying code and deleting as well as console.log on everything to make sure the javascript is running correctly. 




## Installation

When the application opens the user will click on the Start Quiz button and will run through the questions while the timer goes. For every question that the user gets wrong there will be a 5 second deduction in time. When time runs out or the user as reached the end of the quiz there will be a form for the user to input their initials and the score and initials will be stored in local storage on their device. To retrieve the scores, the user will right click on the screen and click on inspect. From there they will click on Application and be brought to the local storage, it will show the scores for anyone who has played on the same device. When you click on value in local storage it will show all the scores below it. Then the user can click on the restart button if they would like to play again. 

## Usage
This quiz can be used to learn more about Javascript, and to also help you see the local storage and the information that is being held onto even after you close out the browser. By right-clicking on the screen and going to inspect you are able to see the scores and how you've improved in your knowledge of javascript.
